    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>The Simpsons is one of the longest running tv or animated shows ever... Welcome to the fandom!!</p>
    <p>The Simpsons is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company.[1][2][3] Developed by Groening, James L. Brooks, and Sam Simon, the series is a satirical depiction of American life, epitomized by the Simpson family, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. Set in the fictional town of Springfield, it caricatures society, Western culture, television, and the human condition.

        The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series of animated shorts with producer Brooks. He created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after his own family members, substituting Bart for his own name; he thought Simpson was a funny name in that it sounded similar to "simpleton".[4] The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. After three seasons, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and became Fox's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989â€“1990).
        
        Since its debut on December 17, 1989, 771 episodes of the show have been broadcast. It is the longest-running American animated series, longest-running American sitcom, and the longest-running American scripted primetime television series, both in seasons and individual episodes. A feature-length film, The Simpsons Movie, was released in theaters worldwide on July 27, 2007, to critical and commercial success, with a sequel in development as of 2018. The series has also spawned numerous comic book series, video games, books, and other related media, as well as a billion-dollar merchandising industry. The Simpsons is produced by Gracie Films with 20th Television distributing the series.[5] It has been distributed under the 20th Television Animation label since 2021, although the animation studio has produced animation for the series since season 28.

    <em>On September 26, 2024, Electronic Arts announced that Tapped Out would be delisted from the App Store and Google Play on October 31, 2024, </em>while users who have the app downloaded would be able to continue playing the game until January 24, 2025, after which the game would be permanently discontinued.</p>
