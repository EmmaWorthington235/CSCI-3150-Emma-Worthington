      <p>
        Your site should be accessible because accesibilty benifits everyone! Universial design is important because the features it includes can help more people then you even mean to initially!! If your site is accesible to more people then more people can use your product! 
        Legally your site needs to meet certain acccesibility standards, so another reason you should make it accesible. Avoid lawsuits by makind sure you meet the required standards.
        And finally it is just human decency! Everyone deserves access to the internet much like everyone deserves access to public place. Buildings are built to be accessible to people with various abilities so the internet should be too.
        Plus it costs a lot less to just build your website to be acccesible then to go back and make it accesible, and laws keep requiring higher and higher amounts of accesibility.
        Soon goverment funded sites will lose some of their funding for not meeting accessible requirements.
