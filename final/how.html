        So how can you make your site accesible? Start with making sure your site meets thes wcag 2.1 aa standards for accesibility. You can look through this list then make sure that your website is compliant.
        There are many online tools to help with this. You can use the wave extension to check your site for errors. If you are having contrast errors with text either make the text larger, or make the contrast higher!
        There are many online tools to check contrast levels and it is important to make sure the ratio fits the size of your text. Paragraph and small text needs the highest contrast, where as headings can have less contrast as they are bigger and easier to read.
        After meeting the aa standards consider going farther to meet aaa standards, because eventually these may become the required standards and even if they don't making your site more accesible serves both you and your users!!
