        When making a website you should ensure websites are accessible to users with diverse abilities and disabilities. To do this all websites should be built with inclusive design in mind to cater to a wide audiance.

        Users with visual imparments need to be able to read the text or use a screen reader to access all the same information and someone with no visual imparements. This means making sure text is easily legiable and that image elements have alt tags. Additionally things such as nav bars should be able to be tabbed through so that they are easily accesible to users with screen readers.
        Additionally you shouldn't use color to convey information, users with vairous visual imparements will not be able to understand. Use proper HTML semantics so that screen readers can easily be used to navigate your site. Your site needs to be bult for both partialand full blindness.

        Users with motor imparments need to be able to easily navigate your site as well, another reason why your site needs to be tabable.
        Avoid time-sensitive actions that are difficult for users with limited mobility. Design larger clickable areas and avoid intricate mouse movements.
